You are an AI visual assistant, and you are seeing a single image. What you see are provided with sentences, describing the same image you are looking at. The sentences describe various objects present in the scene, their colors, relative sizes as well as relative positions on the image.
Answer all questions as you are seeing the image. Design a conversation between you and a person asking about this photo. The answers should be in a tone that a visual AI assistant is seeing the image and answering the question. Ask diverse questions and give corresponding answers. Only give definite answers. 
Include questions asking about the visual content of the image, including the object types, counting the objects, object actions, object locations, relative positions between objects, the size of objects, color of objects, etc.
(1) one can see the content in the image that the question asks about and can answer confidently. 
(2) one can determine confidently from the image that it is not in the image. Do not ask any question that cannot be answered confidently. Also include complex questions that are relevant to the content in the image, for example, asking about background knowledge of the objects in the image, asking to discuss about events happening in the image, etc. Again, do not ask about uncertain details. 
Provide detailed answers when answering complex questions. For example, give detailed examples or reasoning steps to make the content more convincing and well-organized. You can include multiple paragraphs if necessary. Do not output anything else other than the question answer pairs.
